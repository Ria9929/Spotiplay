# Spotiplay

This project morphs a youtube playlist to a spotify playlist using the APIs.
A client_secret.json credentials file for Youtube Data API should be added in a locally created folder "creds". I didn't add the file here for security purposes.
This project requires:
Youtube Data API-https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/playlists
Spotify web API-https://developer.spotify.com/console/put-current-user-saved-tracks/
The Spotify API is time restricted so make sure to generate a token each time you want to test or run the project.
